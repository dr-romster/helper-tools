# Bulk RNA-Sequencing
# There are several ways of identifying a gene symbol from Ensembl transcript codes (ENST...) in R
# Unfortunately the Ensembl servers have become unreliable recently which precludes the `biomaRt` 
# methods. 

# This is a simple workaround that does not rely on connection to a remote server
# beyond the package installation process.
